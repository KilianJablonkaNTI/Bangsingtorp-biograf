Baingsingtorp-biograf is a school project created by Kilian Jablonka. The purpose
 of the project was to create a homepage which is connected to a database where data should be saved. 

The project contains the files for the homepage called Bängsingtorp biograf. The homepage purpose is to have a place where all the movies and series which the home cinema of Bängsingtorp can view will be saved. The users can see which movies and series are available and they can vote on one out of four selected movies which should be viewed at the weekend. The admin can create add new movies which the cinema has bought or delete movies which they don’t have any more. As admin you can also create a vote poll where four movies will be selected to be viewed which the users as explained earlier can vote on. That’s a shot sumare of what the project is about and what you can do on the homepage it contains right now. 

If you would like to play around on the homepage a little bit just clone the repository and spin it up on a local apache server. The xampp, apache and mysql versions used are the following:

Xamppserver version 7.3.1 
Apache Apache version 2.4.37 (Win32) 
Mysql version 15.1 Distrib 10.1.37-MariaDB (Win32).
